# Emotions Portrait


 Every person has their own feelings. Sometimes we can feel happy, sometimes we can feel sad, or maybe sometimes we can feel angry about something. Most of the time, we just want to let it out. We just want to express it, to share it to someone, to tell someone what we're feeling and what is the story behind it.
 
 But sometimes, we're just too afraid to share it with someone, we're just too afraid of what they might think about our story, we're just too over-thinking about their response. In the end, we just keep it to ourselves. It must be frustrating, it must be tiring. But, just keep in mind that every single feeling that appears in your heart, every single thought that you have in your mind, every single one is precious, it is beautiful, it is worth sharing.
 
 Therefore, you can share whatever that you have in your mind with this app. It will be kept as an art, art of your own emotions.
